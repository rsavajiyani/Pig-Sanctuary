                    <p> Providing a safe, secure and pig-proof outdoor area is not only key to keeping pigs happy, but also to
                        keeping the inside of the house (and any fancy landscaping) from being destroyed. In the wild, Jen
                        explains, pigs are “opportunistic scavengers” who spend the vast majority of their days rooting around
                        in the ground searching for food. It’s a natural, instinctual behavior that doesn’t go away when
                        pigs are kept indoors. If pigs can’t root around in the ground, they’ll turn to the next best thing,
                        which may be the new carpet or that expensive couch. A bored, frustrated pig can do a lot of damage
                        quickly. Lack of mental stimulation for a pig can also lead to aggressive behavior toward humans,
                        such as charging or biting.</p>
                    <p>It’s especially important to note that pigs are social creatures. In the wild, they live in communities
                        called sounders. Single pigs don’t tend to do as well and develop more behavioral problems than those
                        who live with other pigs. “People are often surprised that a lot of aggression issues go away if
                        they add another pig,” says Jen. Another crucial part of pig care is proper feeding. Breeders often
                        prescribe a very restrictive diet for piglets, claiming that it will ensure that adult teacup pigs
                        don’t exceed their size and weight expectations.</p>
                    <p>But these diets, designed to keep pigs as tiny as possible (and sometimes consisting of only a single
                        food, such as oatmeal), often amount to starvation. Along with poor breeding practices (such as in-breeding
                        to produce smaller and smaller pigs), malnutrition due to underfeeding can lead to a host of lifelong
                        health problems for a miniature pig pet. Currently there are several adoptable pigs living at the
                        Sanctuary who were once purchased from breeders as teacup pigs. They lost their homes when they didn’t
                        turn out to be quite what their people were expecting, or they developed serious health problems.</p>

                <p>
                    For people who already have potbellied pigs, as well as for people who are looking to adopt them, Jen says, “We do lots and
                    lots of education about good diet and how to maintain a good weight and body condition.” A well-rounded
                    diet is just as important for pigs as it is for people, though feeding pigs most human foods is strongly
                    discouraged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s because a high percentage of people food is not only processed, but also high in fat and sodium. Pigs are very sensitive
                    to these things. However, they do quite well on a vegetarian diet. At the Sanctuary, pigs enjoy a vegetarian
                    diet full of fruits, veggies and greens. They also eat pellets made for pigs and formulated for lifetime
                    nutrition
                </p>
                <p>
                    While even the healthiest and most balanced diet can’t erase the damage caused by in-breeding or early malnutrition, it can
                    put a small pig pet like Rosie on the road to better health and wellness. But as long as there is a demand
                    for teacup pigs as pets, breeders will keep trying to breed and raise smaller and smaller pigs in spite
                    of the harmful health effects. Meanwhile, rescue organizations, shelters and sanctuaries strain their
                    resources to meet the needs of pigs who have become ill or were abandoned, or who simply need to find
                    new homes.
